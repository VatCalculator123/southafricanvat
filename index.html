        <h1>Value-added tax (VAT) on property in South Africa</h1>
        <p>Value-added tax is an indirect tax that significantly contributes to the South African economy. 
        This tax is charged on transactions of goods and services. The South African government
        introduced VAT under the Value-added Tax Act in 1991. The VAT rate in South Africa is divided
        into two components: standard rate and zero rate. Those businesses carrying out their day-to-day operations on South African soil must adhere to tax compliance and regulations published
        by the South African Revenue Service (SARS). To be tax-compliant, It is important to <a href="https://vatcalculatorfree.co.za/">add or
            remove VAT</a> accurately at the time of buying or selling products.</p>
        
        <p>The current standard VAT rate in South Africa is 15%. If a business fails to comply with the rule,
        SARS can penalize it. The standard VAT rate applies to all the products in South Africa. The
        government introduced a Zero VAT rate to help the people who fall below the poverty line. This
        Zero VAT rate scheme covers all the basic items necessary for our day-to-day life. This means
        all the basic items are taxable but the VAT rate applied on these items is 0. The concept of VAT
        exemption is slightly different from the Zero-rated VAT. In VAT exemption, some items are not
        subject to VAT. Examples of VAT-exempt items are educational services, residential property,
        certain banking services, and more.</p>
        
        <p>The South African government implemented some VAT guidelines so that the VAT collection
        while purchasing or selling residential or commercial properties is transparent. Section 11 of the
        VAT Act states that you need to pay Value-added tax on residential property transactions.
        However, if you buy a commercial property, you must pay VAT to the SARS. The reason is the
        sale or the rent of commercial property falls under the tax bracket.</p>
        
        <p>If a residential property is used as a home, VAT will not apply. As the owner once used it as a
        permanent or primary resident, the property is exempt from VAT. If the owner used it as a
        secondary home or collected rent from that property, VAT would apply to it. Vacant land, once
        used for residential purposes, is exempt from VAT. VAT applies to those properties used for
        business or other commercial purposes. At the time of selling property, be it residential or
        commercial, you must notify SARS. For this process, you need to submit a VAT 263 form.
        Additionally, you must submit all the necessary documents to confirm the status of your
        property. If you earn a profit from selling your property, you need to pay other taxes apart from
        VAT. These taxes include Capital gain tax (CGT).</p>
        
        <p>Now, the question is if you run a small business from your residence, will you need to pay VAT?
        The answer is NO. But, there is a condition. If your business covers more than 50% of the floor
        place, you must pay VAT. If you still find it hard to determine whether your property is taxable or
        VAT-exempt, you can take advice from your tax consultant.</p>
        
        <p>Those properties that are used as old age homes for retirees are considered VAT-exempt
        properties. These properties can be cottages, houses, or any villages.</p>
